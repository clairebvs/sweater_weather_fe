This application was created as the first project of the Module 4 (see Turing's curriculum) to build a front-end using JS, JQuery to consume our API created previously as our backend app (https://github.com/clairebvs/sweater_weather). 

The application is divided in three cards : 
- top left card that contains current weather and location information
- top right card that contains more detailed current weather information 
- bottom/main card that contains the hourly weather (9 times) and the forecast for the next 5 days.
